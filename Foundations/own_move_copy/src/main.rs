/*
We start out with two values, the number 42 and a Box (a heap-allocated
value) containing the number 84. The former is Copy, whereas the latter is
not. When we place x1 and y1 into the tuple z 1, x1 is copied into z, whereas
y1 is moved into z. At this point, x1 continues to be accessible and can be
used again 3. On the other hand, y1 is rendered inaccessible once its value
has been moved 4, and any attempt to access it would incur a compiler
error. When z goes out of scope 2, the tuple value it contains is dropped,
and this in turn drops the value copied from x1 and the one moved from y1.
When the Box from y1 is dropped, it also deallocates the heap memory used
to store y1â€™s value.
